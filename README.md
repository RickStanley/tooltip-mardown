# Tooltip Markdown

I just want a simple tooltip markdown converter. The use case is simple: there is a dashboard, you want the editor to be able to use the basic functionalities of Markdown, let's say "bold" or "italic", you search on the internet, you find Medium Markdown, or some other, but one depends on a plugin or the others are just abbandoned, left behind.

- This library should be compatible with ES6-7-Next standards.
- This library should be plug and play, just import the module into the javascript and create an instance.
- The elements should be customizable through plain CSS Custom Variables.

And of course, I'm just playing around trying to get the basics for now, so we need to clean it up once we have a version 1.0.0.
